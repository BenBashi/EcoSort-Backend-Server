# 1. update_result(): Allows users to update the ImageClass field for a sample.
#    This typically involves:
#      - receiving a sample_id (or _id) from the frontend/dashboard
#      - receiving a new classification (e.g., "Paper", "Plastic", etc.)
#      - updating the database record's "ImageClass" field accordingly
def update_result(sample_id, new_class):
    """
    Skeleton for updating the ImageClass field of a given sample in the database.
    """
    # TODO: Implement your database update logic here.
    # e.g., samples_collection.update_one({"_id": ObjectId(sample_id)}, {"$set": {"ImageClass": new_class}})
    pass


# 2. get_results(): Retrieves all samples from the database for display in a dashboard table.
#    Typically returns a list of samples, including any fields you want to show in the UI.
def get_results():
    """
    Skeleton for fetching all sample documents from the database.
    """
    # TODO: Implement your database find logic.
    # e.g., return list(samples_collection.find())
    pass


# 3. calculate_accuracy(): Calculates system accuracy based on manually updated classifications.
#    You might:
#      - retrieve all samples
#      - compare 'SystemAnalysis' vs. the final 'ImageClass' (the manually updated value)
#      - compute a percentage of correct matches
def calculate_accuracy():
    """
    Skeleton for computing overall accuracy of the system's classifications
    compared to manually updated "ImageClass" fields.
    """
    # TODO: Implement your logic to compare fields, tally correct vs. incorrect,
    #       and return a percentage or other metric (e.g., 85.4%).
    pass


# 4. default_model(): Activates set_default_model() to reset the active classifier 
#    to the default pre-trained model.
#    This usually calls some function (e.g., set_default_model()) that:
#      - loads original model weights
#      - updates references/flags that mark it as the "active" model
def default_model():
    """
    Skeleton for resetting the active classifier to the default pre-trained model.
    """
    # TODO: Call your internal function here.
    # e.g., set_default_model()
    pass


# 5. retrain(): Invokes retrain_model() to enhance classifier accuracy by incorporating
#    failed classifications and manually corrected data into the training set, then re-trains.
#    This often includes:
#      - collecting all mislabeled samples (where SystemAnalysis != ImageClass)
#      - adding them to your training dataset
#      - calling retrain_model() to start the training process
def retrain():
    """
    Skeleton for re-training the model using updated/mislabeled data.
    """
    # TODO: Call your internal function here.
    # e.g., retrain_model()
    pass
